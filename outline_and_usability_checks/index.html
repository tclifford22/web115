            <p>This past month I was given the chance, through work, to skate on the Blackhawkâ€™s ice rink at the United Center. While working at Imagetec in McHenry, I was given the chance to work with WGN, one of the prominent radio stations, and participate in their Christmas skating party. Since WGN is one of the Blackhawks biggest sponsors they were able to rent out the rink for their annual party. Skating on their ice rink was a huge dream come true. Ever since I was a kid I had always wanted to be on their rink. I had watched countless times all of my cousins get to play on the ice and since I never participated in a hockey league I was never granted that chance. WGN was nice enough to even provide me with an extra ticket for me to have a plus one. My girlfriend and I had a blast having the whole ice practically to ourselves seeing as how out of the 100 people that attended only about 15 actually skated on the ice. We had 2 full hours of skate with an hour for dinner after that. As people moved off the ice we were soon to have the entire ice to the 2 of us. It was honestly one of the coolest experiences of my life and I am positive when I say that I will never forget it.</p>
